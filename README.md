## General info
This "Sentiment Stockticker Dashboard"-Project deals with the topic of sentiment analysis and was written in the context of the lecture "Projektrealisierung" in the course WWI18DSB Wirtschaftsinformatik Data Science at DHBW Mannheim. 
The contributors (GitHub name) to this project were 
* Anabel Lilja (anabellilja)
* Bjarne Gerdes (bjarnege)
* Johannes Deufel (Johannes998)
* Nina Mergelsberg (NinaM98) and 
* Simone Marx (SimoneMarx)

### Objective and approach
The goal of this project involves the development of machine learning models that generate recommendations for capital investments based on current news data. These recommendations are comprehensive and take into account a wide variety of factors. In order to give customers a comprehensible overview of how investment recommendations are calculated, both the price fluctuations of the investments and an individually calculated ranking score are shown. 

In addition to the technical development of the models, the preparation of various economic and project-specific analyses is a primary focus of this project.
